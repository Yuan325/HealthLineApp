# HealthLineApp
Healthcare workers often live in a constant state of fear of catching and spreading the virus to others around them. Many are even under a lot of psychological stress due to things like fear of infection and lack of social support and felt that they lacked pandemic preparedness.Delays in testing meant many workers are left unsure of whether or not they are infected or not, leading to unknowingly spreading the virus and causing staff shortages.

For these reasons, we decided to create a mobile application called Healthline that will provide a hub of resources for front line health care workers in an effort to alleviate the tremendous amounts of demands and stress put upon them.  

Healthline provides a plethora of useful resources for health care workers such as discussion forums for workers to connect with one another, real time live updates on COVID-19 cases around their area and on an international scale, and mental health resources. 

We created a prototype of the mobile application using Figma which showcases the broad range of features we have in mind for the application. We used ReactNative to build the actual framework for the iOS app and used git/github as our version control system. Moreover, we included API’s to help render data which were created using Google Cloud and BigQuery. Firebase was used to sign users up and log them in to access the main features of the app.

We hope to launch our app on the app store and allow it to be used by actual health care workers. Furthermore, we would love to seek feedback and learn what these workers really like about the app and what are some things that could be changed to make the app better. Also, we want to make the login process more secure especially since the app is targeted for an international audience. Moreover, we want to also expand the backend database sect of the app to make sure our users’ credentials are secure and organized.
